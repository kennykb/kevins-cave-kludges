In this episode, we look at one way to classify amplifiers, by their source and output signals. There are four classes: voltage amplifiers, current amplifiers, transconductance amplifiers (voltage-controlled current sources), and transimpedance amplifiers (current-to-voltage converters). We study one particular type of op-amp transimpedance amplifier - one designed to detect a tiny current and emit a useful voltage. We use the amplifier to build a photometer: a device for measuring the amoutn of light that strikes a sensor.
