# Op-Amp Basics
## Episode 2: The Op-Amp Adder

Op-amp amplifiers work by balancing currents. In this video, we explore non-inverting and inverting amplifiers.  We add additional inputs to the inverting amplifier, creating a circuit that adds two signals together.  By making the signals into constant voltages, each of which is double the previous one, we create a digital-to-analog converter.
