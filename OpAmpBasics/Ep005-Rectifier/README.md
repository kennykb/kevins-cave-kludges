In this episode, we look at precision half-wave and full-wave
rectifiers, op-amp circuits to clamp an input signal to the ground
or take its absolute value.

In the process, we learn about op-amp slew rate and how it limits the
performance of circuits that need to make sudden voltage changes.

All the schematics of the demo circuits this time fit on a single page,
so they're all bundled together.
