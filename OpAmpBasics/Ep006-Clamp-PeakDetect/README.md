In this episode, we take a second look at the precision half-wave rectifier,
elaborate it to voltage clamps and peak detectors, study the effect of
slew rate some more, and discover the phenomenon of voltage droop.

All the schematics of the demo circuits this time fit on a single page,
so they're all bundled together.  There's a second page with the test
rig for the peak detector
