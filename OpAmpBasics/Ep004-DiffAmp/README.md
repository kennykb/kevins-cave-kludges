# Op-Amp Basics
## Episode 4: Difference Amplifiers and Inputs Beyond the Rails

Video link: [Difference Amplifiers and Inputs Beyond the Rails](https://youtu.be/CsjGMV5cHjc)

In this episode, we look at the differential amplifier, which
generates an output voltage equal to the difference between the
input voltages.

We demonstrate a difference amp used as a line receiver,
and another difference amp that can be used to break up ground
loops in the connections between devices.

We see how difference amps can be configured to respond to voltages
beyond the power rails, and demonstrate non-inverting and inverting
amps that take inputs around ground and bias them for use with
a single-ended power supply (such as a battery-powered device).

We show (without demonstrating) that the inputs to difference amplifiers
can be set up even for voltages far beyond the power rails, making
them useful for voltage and current monitoring in high-voltage
systems such as battery stacks and vacuum tube plate supplies.

All the schematics of the demo circuits this time fit on a single page,
so they're all bundled together.
