# Op-Amp Basics
## Episode 3: The Monster in the Feedback Loop

We examine the effects of non-linear components in the feedback loop of an op-amp circuit, and see how they function either to invert some function of the input signal, or to compensate for some defect in a downstream stage. We build a simple logarithmic amplifier and a too-simple speaker power amplifier to demonstrate two of the circuits.
