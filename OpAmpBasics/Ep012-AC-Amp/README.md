In this episode, we look at the issue of managing a high gain in a single op-amp, where the op-amp's voltage offset at the input would far exceed the signal level at the output. We fix the problem with an AC amplifier, where the gain rolls to zero at DC. As an example, we design a preamplifier for an electret microphone capsule.
