In this episode, we begin examining transconductanse amplifiers, whose input signals are expressed as voltages and whose output signals are expressed as currents.  We build first a current source with a floating load, then show how the load can be returned to ground, and finally show how both source and load can be ground-referenced.  There are numerous side paths for testing and debugging of the amplifiers.
