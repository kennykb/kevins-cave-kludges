The video discusses the long-tailed pair, the basic circuit that
forms the input of virtually all op-amps and other analog devices.

Any matched pair of NPN transistors should work in place of the DMMT5551
used here. MMDT2222A, DMMT3904W, MMDT4401, and PMP4201Y would all be
candidates if the pinouts in the schematic are adjusted appropriately.
